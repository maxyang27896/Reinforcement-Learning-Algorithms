# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
A list of reinforcement learning exercises that applies different algorithms to the the environments in OpenAI Gym to train agents to play games optimally. I can't! 

## Taxi V3
A Q-table learning from the bellmen equation was implemented to find the optimal action in a taxi environment. 

## Frozen Lake
A Monte carlo reinformcement learning algorithm was implemented to solve the frozen lake problem. 

## Cartpole
Two methods was applied to the cartpole problem
* Q-table learning - An obervation wrapper was applied to discretise the continous state space and then a Q-table learning algorithm was applied. 
* Deep Q Learning - The input state was kept as continous inputs and a neural network (Deep Q Network) was used to model state to action function. The DQN was optimised for maximum rewards.
